# pick-the-lyrics

A repository for exploring lyrics data. Take a look at [this notebook](https://github.com/avault/pick-the-lyrics/blob/master/MillionSongSubset/meta_analysis.ipynb) as a starting point.

A lot of the data comes from either the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/pages/getting-dataset) or [Musixmatch](https://www.musixmatch.com/).
